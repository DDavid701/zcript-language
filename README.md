Zcript is an programming language built using Python.
Zcript code (.zc) can be compiled (to .py files) or 'interpreted' with the zcript language. so you can use it as an interpreted language or compiled language sort of.

## Why?
I dont really know how Zcript is useful or why i made it but yeah...

# Setup
If you have Linux installed (only works on linux!) and want to install it follow these steps:

1. Download the newest version and unzip the file.
2. Open a terminal in the folder.
3. In the terminal type ```sh setup.sh```
4. Then follow the setup :D

Good luck .-.
